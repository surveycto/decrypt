# Demo steps

Use these steps to try out the "decrypt" field plug-in in SurveyCTO.

**Part 1: Access the form**

1. Go to https://successdemo.surveycto.com/.
1. Log into the server using the the credentials you were given.
1. Go to the Design tab of the server console.
1. Go to the group "Decryption field plug-in". If it is closed, click the arrows.
1. For the form with the title "Decryption sample form", click the *Test* button. The form will open in a new tab.

**Part 2: Use the form**

1. When prompted for the ID, enter either `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`.
1. When prompted for the passkey, enter `password`.
1. Go to the next field. This will be the field with the field plug-in.
1. Go to the next field. This is a regular *note* field that displays the original cipher text and the decrypted data.

Here are some things you can try with the sample form:

* Go back to the ID field, and enter a different ID, to see how all data can be decrypted.
* Try entering a different passkey, and see how the data cannot be decrypted anymore.
